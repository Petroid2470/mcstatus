# MCStatus
Simple status page for a Minecraft server, made with the [mcsrvstat.us API](https://api.mcsrvstat.us) and using Tailwind CSS for aesthetic

Features: 

 1. Server favicon support
 2. Custom MOTD color support
 3. Easy to use and looks good

List of improvements to do in the future:
 1. Change to the HTML MOTD from the API instead of parsing the regular one with the ยง
 2. Add obfuscated text (ยงk) support
